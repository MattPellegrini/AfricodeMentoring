#Function Challenges
Try to write small python functions to the problems below.

## Challenge 1
```
def dice_rolls(dice_1: int, dice_2:int) -> None:
    # Complete this function that prints the sum of the two dice rolls.
    # Also, if the roll is a double (both dice are the same number), print another line to say "Double!"
    ...


# Example 1
# INPUT: dice_rolls(4, 1)
# OUTPUT: "The total is 5."

# Example 2
# INPUT: dice_rolls(3, 3)
# OUTPUT: "The total is 6."
#         "Double!"
```

## Challenge 2
Write a function that takes a shopping list, and a single item and print either, "Item is on the list" or "Item is not on the list".
The types are as follows: the shopping list should be a list of strings, the item should be a string.
```
# Example 1
# INPUT: check_item_on_list(["Apples", "Oranges", "Bread"], "Cookies")
# OUTPUT: "Item is not on the list."

# Example 2
# INPUT: check_item_on_list(["Carrots", "Pineapple", "Peppers"], "Carrots")
# OUTPUT: "Item is on the list."
```
